== Description ==

This plugin shows you the top spam commentators and their IP addresses on a new
admin/tools subpage. You can filter them by setting a minimum amount of spam comments.

It also features an export area, that gives you the possibility to easily copy them to
the clipboard to block them via your <code>.htaccess</code> file.

The plugin was built after reading Thomas "toscho" Scholz blog post on WPKrauts
about [penetrant spammers](http://wpkrauts.com/2013/get-ip-addresses-from-most-penetrant-spammers/).

To catch as much spam as possible, we recommend using the
[AntiSpam Bee](http://antispambee.com/) plugin by Sergej M&uuml;ller.

This plugin is written under the WeCodeMore plugin label.
